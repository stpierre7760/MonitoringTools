#	Check OS X DHCP Status
#	modified by Jonathan Cohen
#	original script by Jedda Wignall
#	http://jedda.me

#	v1.1 - 21 Nov 2016
#	v1.0 - 7 Dec 2012 (Jedda)
#	Initial release.

#	Script that uses serveradmin to check that the OS X Server DHCP service is listed as running.
#	If all is OK, it checks that the number of active clients does not exceed a set threshold, then
#	returns performance data for the number of provided leases and number of active clients.

#	Required Arguments:
#	-w		Warning threshold for active clients. Script throws WARNING if number of active clients is greater than or equals the supplied number.
#	-c		Critical threshold for active clients. Script throws CRITICAL if number of active clients is greater than or equals the supplied number.
#	-t 		The target /24 subnet in the following notation "x.x.x" quotes are required.

#	Example:
#	./check_osx_swupdate.sh -w 120 -c 180

#	Performance Data - this script returns the followng Nagios performance data:
#	providedLeases -		Number of leases provided to clients (active & non-active).
#	activeClients -			Number of clients with an active lease.

#	Compatibility - this script has been tested on and functions on the following stock OSes:
#	10.6 Server
#	10.7 Server
#	10.8 Server
#	10.11.6 Server (Jonathan)
